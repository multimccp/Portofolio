      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Multimedia and Communication Technologies student at the University of Aveiro, Portugal, with a strong interest in web development. More than just building functional websites, I‚Äôm driven by the challenge of creating digital experiences that truly stand out ‚Äî through design, interactivity, and the unique ways they express ideas.
      </p>
      <p>I believe the best way to learn is by doing. I work with complete focus: I don‚Äôt leave things unfinished, I like solving problems on my own, and I see every project as a real opportunity to grow. What drives me is innovation ‚Äî creating technological solutions that are useful, expressive, and meaningful.</p>
      <p>My personal mantra: <b>"Build with purpose. Play with heart. Code for impact."</b></p>
